Error in number of argments to this program.  Arguments should be:
     - Full path to a Gaussian file
         - This can either be a MatrixFile
         - This can be a Gaussian input file
     - The name of the binary for the program that 
       generates the MatrixFile, most likely "g16".  
       The environment should be setup to run the program.
ERROR: Only one argument to this program
